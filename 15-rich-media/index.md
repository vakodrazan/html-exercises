# HTML exercise 15: Rich media

HTML5 brought some new elements that can help us display rich media, elements such as `audio`, `video` and even a `canvas` for drawing amazing 2D or 3D interactive environments.

In this folder, you'll find a video, audio, and javascript file. Your job is to:

- Have a `video` element with its controls load up and play the video file.
- Have an `audio` element with its controls load up and play the audio file.
- Load the JavaScript in the page using a `script` element,
- Apply the CSS to the page using a `link` element, and lastly,
- Provide a `canvas` element for the JavaScript to draw on.
