# HTML exercise 10: Form to Google Sheets

Now let's heat things up a bit! All this time, we've been trying to build forms, but never see them working as they should.

I've built [a little Script Add-on](https://script.google.com/a/onja.org/d/1MemwIrVw-0kOBR-JfCeJnUPW8CKWq0hzPSdngnJsmALJvO3dcRiahXxb/edit?usp=sharing) for a [special Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vnkb5rE1kgXFMt2So3RwfvfLwayVtATt1o9NM-ry9UI/edit?usp=sharing).

Take a look at the `Form Data` Sheet. Do those fields look familiar? ðŸ¤“

Now, using those header cells as field names, build an HTML form that a user can use to capture Malagasy Artists.

Pay special attention to the following:

- `contributor` is you! Specify your first name as the value for this field.
- `genre` could be a list of genres the user can choose from, but we only want their primary genre
- `artist_id` should apply our file-naming rule, and is required.
- `artist_name` is required
- The rest of the fields are optional.
