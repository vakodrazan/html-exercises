# Weekend Project: Mockup to HTML

As a front-end web developer, you're going to be turning design work into HTML (and CSS) on an almost daily basis.

Let's practice this by looking at a reference design, and start cutting it up into the most appropriate HTML we can think of.

In this folder, you'll find `blog_design.png`. Your job is to write the HTML for this page design in `14-blog-design.html`, which you'll then hand over to a CSS developer to complete.

You'll need to:

- write everything from scratch, and base it off your own interpretation of what element is the best for each case.
- make sure your document is well-structured, i.e. use sectioning elements.
- make sure you use headings properly
- make your own interpretation about what URLs the links go to.
- not worry about the way it looks. Your document should be easy to understand without CSS.

Also, take note, there are no images required for this HTML.

Good luck!
