# HTML exercise 03: Nested lists

In the accompanying file `03-nested-lists.html` you'll find an empty `<body>` element. Let's try make an HTML nested list inside that HTML file. 

Make it look like the following:

---

- Chimpanzees
- Gibbons
- Gorillas
- Lemurs
  1. Aye-aye
     - Scary fingers
     - Scrawny head
     - Not so cute

     - Super cute
     - Really small
  1. Ring-tailed Lemur
