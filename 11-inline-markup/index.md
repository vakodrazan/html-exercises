# HTML exercise 11: Inline markup

There are many HTML elements that are designed to wrap a few words at a time, to add emphasis, attribution, or show changes. These elements can typically be nested with one another, and belong inside other block-like elements like `<p>`, or `<li>`.

In this exercise, you'll need to use the inline elements mentioned below, on the appropriate words in the `11-inline-markup.html` file.

Some of the inline elements:

- `<abbr>`
- `<b>`
- `<code>`
- `<del>`
- `<dfn>`
- `<em>`
- `<i>`
- `<ins>`
- `<kbd>`
- `<mark>`
- `<pre>`
- `<q>`
- `<s>`
- `<small>`
- `<span>`
- `<strong>`
- `<sub>`
- `<sup>`
- `<time>`
- `<var>`
- `<u>`

Save, `add`, and then `commit` your changes in your forked repo. Make sure to `push`!
