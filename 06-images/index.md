# HTML exercise 06: Images

In the accompanying file `06-images.html` you'll find 5 sections describing each of the web-friendly image types we can use with an image element or `<img>`.

In this exercise, you first need to link up each of the examples to their associated files by adjusting the source attribute (`src`) to match the file in the `img` subfolder.

You'll notice that the different file types are better suited for certain types of imagery.

Can you associate each item in the following list, with each file type?

- Good for photos
- Best for vector images
- Best for everything except vectors, but not widely supported.
- Great for graphics, charts, and other generated images.

Save, add, and then `commit` your changes in your forked repo. Make sure to `push`!
