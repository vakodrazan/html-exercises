# HTML Exercise 13: Semantic HTML

In this exercise, we're going to turn English instructions into HTML. e.g.…

> Make a link to https://dndbeyond.com that says 'Dungeons and Dragons'.

…becomes…

```
<a href="https://dndbeyond.com">
  Dungeons and Dragons
</a>
```

Open `13-semantics.html` and write out the correct, and most meaningful HTML you can, for each section.
