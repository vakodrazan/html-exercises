# HTML exercise 08: A log in form

Forms help users submit and save information with web servers.

There are many HTML elements we use when working with forms, this exercise will introduce you to some of the fundamental elements.

In the accompanying file, `08-log-in-form.html`, add the necessary markup, so that user can enter their e-mail address and password.

The web server is expecting the following fields:

- `username`: The user's email address
- `password`: The user's password.

Both fields are required.

The user's login details must be `POST`ed to the following URL: `/log-in`

Save, `add`, and then `commit` your changes in your forked repo. Make sure to `push`!
