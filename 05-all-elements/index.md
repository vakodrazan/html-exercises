# HTML exercise 05: All elements

In the accompanying file `05-all-elements.html` we want to list as many HTML elements as we can, and we're going to use a definition list to do it. So far, we've come to know 40-50 elements. Can you list and describe them all?

I've started your work with the first two elements. Take a look. ðŸ¤“

> **Note:** In the `<dt>`, use a `<code>` element to write out each element, in alphabetical order. You'll notice there's a special way to rewrite the Less than (`<`) and Greater than (`>`) characters.

Save, add, and then `commit` your changes in your forked repo. Make sure to `push`!
